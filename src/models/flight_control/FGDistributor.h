/** Encapsulates a distributor for the flight control system.

The distributor component models a distributor - 

Within a test, additional tests can be specified, which allows for
complex groupings of logical comparisons. Each test contains
additional conditions, as well as possibly additional tests.

@code
<distributor name="name/is/irrelevant" type="exclusive|inclusive">

  <case>
    [<test logic="{AND|OR}" value="{property|value}">
      {property} {conditional} {property|value}
      <test logic="{AND|OR}">
        {property} {conditional} {property|value}
        ...
      </test>
      ...
    </test>] <!-- Optional <test> one time. A <case> without a <test> is always executed -->
    <property value="number|property"> property_name </property>
    ...
  </case>

  ... <!-- Additional cases -->

</distributor>
@endcode

Here's an example:

@code

@endcode

Note: In the "logic" attribute, "AND" is the default logic, if none is supplied.
